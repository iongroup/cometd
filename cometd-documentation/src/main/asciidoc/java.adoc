== Java Libraries

The CometD Java implementation is based on the popular https://eclipse.org/jetty[Jetty Http Server and Servlet Container], for both the client and the server, version 12 or greater.

=== CometD Java Libraries and Jakarta EE 11 / Servlet 6.1

The CometD Java implementation, though based on Jetty, is based on the standard Jakarta EE 11 / Servlet 6.1 APIs and therefore can be deployed to any Jakarta EE 11 / Servlet 6.1 or greater compliant Servlet Container, leveraging the asynchronous features the Servlet Container offers.
See also xref:_java_server_configuration_servlet[the Servlet 6.0 configuration section] for further details.

The CometD Java Implementation offers a client library and a server library, which the following sections document in detail.
