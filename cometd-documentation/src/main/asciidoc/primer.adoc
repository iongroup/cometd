=== Preparing

Working on a project that uses the CometD API requires preparation, especially regarding tools, that can save you a huge amount of time.
Each browser has its own version of the Developer Tools, where you typically have a JavaScript console tool available, a network trace tool, a CSS editor tool, etc.

The CometD project is built using https://maven.apache.org[Maven], and using Maven to also build your application is a natural fit.
This Primer uses Maven as the basis for the setup, build and run of your application, but other build tools can apply the same concepts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.Windows Users
If you are working in the Windows OS, avoid at all costs using a path that contains spaces, such as `+C:\Document And Settings\+`, as your base path.
Use a base path such as `+C:\CometD\+` instead.
====

=== Setting Up the Project

You can set up the project in two ways: using xref:_primer_maven_way[the Maven way] or xref:_primer_non_maven_way[the non Maven way].
For both, you can follow xref:_primer_setup_details[setup section] to see how some of the files of the project are set up.

[[_primer_maven_way]]
==== The Maven Way

Setting up a project based on the CometD libraries using Maven uses the Maven _archetypes_, which create the skeleton of the project, in a style very similar to other projects scaffolding.

Issue the following command from a directory that does _not_ contain a `pom.xml` file (otherwise you will get a Maven error), for example an empty directory:

----
$ cd /tmp
$ mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.cometd.archetypes:jetty12
----
----
Choose archetype:
1: remote -> org.cometd.archetypes:cometd-archetype-es6-jetty12 (-)
2: remote -> org.cometd.archetypes:cometd-archetype-jquery-jetty12 (-)
3: remote -> org.cometd.archetypes:cometd-archetype-spring-es6-jetty12 (-)
4: remote -> org.cometd.archetypes:cometd-archetype-spring-jquery-jetty12 (-)
Choose a number:
----

As you can see, there are archetypes available that build a skeleton application using plain ES6 or using http://jquery.com[jQuery], both with the choice of using Jetty and/or Spring.
Choose ES6 with Jetty, which in the example above is archetype number `1` (it may have a different number for you).

Next, you have to choose the version of the archetype you want to use, typically the last version of the 8.0.x series:

----
Choose org.cometd.archetypes:cometd-archetype-es6-jetty12 version:
...
3: 8.0.0
...
----

The archetype generation requires that you define several properties and generates the application skeleton for you, for example:

----
Define value for property 'groupId': : org.cometd.primer
Define value for property 'artifactId': : es6-jetty12-primer
Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT: :
Define value for property 'package':  org.cometd.primer: :
[INFO] Using property: cometd-version = 8.0.0
[INFO] Using property: jetty-version = 12.0.0
...
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: org.cometd.primer
artifactId: es6-jetty12-primer
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
package: org.cometd.primer
cometd-version: 8.0.0
jetty-version: 12.0.0
...
Y: :
...
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
----

[NOTE]
====
Do not worry for now about the Jetty version that is being used to generate
the application skeleton, since it can be easily changed afterward.
====

Then:

----
$ cd es6-jetty12-primer/
----

The skeleton project now exists as follows:

----
$ tree .
.
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- main
        |-- java
        |   `-- org
        |       `-- cometd
        |           `-- primer
        |               |-- CometDInitializer.java
        |               `-- HelloService.java
        +-- resources
        |   `-- jetty-logging.properties
        `-- webapp
            |-- application.js
            |-- index.jsp
            `-- WEB-INF
                `-- web.xml
----

The skeleton project is ready for you to run using the following command:

----
$ mvn clean install
$ mvn jetty:run
----

Now point your browser at `+http://localhost:8080/es6-jetty12-primer+`, and you should see this message:

----
Server Says: Hello, World
CometD Connection Established
----

That's it.
You have already written your first CometD application :-)

If you want to use a Jetty version different from CometD's default Jetty version, you can easily do so by opening the main `pom.xml` file and modifying the value of the `jetty-version` element, for example:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<project ... >

    ...

    <properties>
        ...
        <jetty-version>12.0.0</jetty-version>
        ...
    </properties>

    ...

</project>
----

Then you just need to re-build and re-run the project as explained above.

[[_primer_non_maven_way]]
==== The Non-Maven Way

The client-side files necessary to set up a CometD project can be obtained in two ways:

* From the https://github.com/cometd/cometd-javascript[CometD JavaScript] mirror repository.
  This is a repository that only hosts the JavaScript files of the main CometD project.
* From the Maven Central Repository by downloading artifact `cometd-javascript-common-<version>.war`.
  The JavaScript files in the `/js/cometd` directory.

The server-side dependencies are typically the following:
----
# CometD dependencies.
cometd-java-api-common-<version>.jar
cometd-java-api-server-<version>.jar
cometd-java-java-common-<version>.jar
cometd-java-java-server-common-<version>.jar
cometd-java-java-server-http-jakarta-<version>.jar
cometd-java-java-server-websocket-common-<version>.jar
cometd-java-java-server-websocket-jakarta-<version>.jar
slf4j-api-<version>.jar

# Jetty dependencies.
jetty-http-<version>.jar
jetty-io-<version>.jar
jetty-util-<version>.jar
jetty-util-ajax-<version>.jar

# Optional Jetty dependency for CrossOriginFilter.
jetty-ee10-servlets-<version>.jar

# SLF4J logging implementation.
jetty-slf4j-impl-<version>.jar
----

You may have different dependencies if you choose to use different CometD or Jetty features.

The details of the server side configuration and service development are explained in xref:_java_server[the Java server library section].

The last step is to write a JSP (or HTML) file that downloads the JavaScript dependencies and the JavaScript application, as explained in the following section.

[[_primer_setup_details]]
==== Setup Details

The JSP (or HTML) file `index.jsp` contains the reference to the JavaScript application file:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>CometD</title>
    <script type="module" src="application.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const config = {
        contextPath: "${pageContext.request.contextPath}"
      };
    </script>
  </head>
<body>
  ...
</body>
</html>
----

The reason to use a JSP file rather than an HTML file is that JSP allows you to more easily obtain contextual information such as the web application context path, but it is not necessary.

In the example above, the JSP file configures a JavaScript configuration object name `config`, with fields that the JavaScript application might need, for example `contextPath`.
This is totally optional.

The JavaScript application, contained in the `application.js` file, configures the `cometd` object and starts the application.
The archetypes provide the following implementation, that you can use as inspiration to write your own:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../../../../cometd-archetypes/cometd-archetype-es6-jetty12/src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/main/webapp/application.js[]
----

Note the following:

* The use of the `DOMContentLoaded` event to wait for the document to load up before executing the `cometd` object initialization.
* The use of the `onbeforeunload` to disconnect when the page is refreshed or closed (see also xref:_extensions_reload[here] for further information about page unloading handling).
* The use of the function `+_metaHandshake()+` to set up the initial configuration on first contact with the server (or when the server has lost client information, for example because of a server restart).
  This is totally optional, but highly recommended, and it is the recommended way to perform subscriptions.
* The use of the function `+_metaConnect()+` to detect when the communication has been successfully established (or re-established).
  This is totally optional, but highly recommended. +
Be warned that the use of the `+_metaConnect()+` along with the `+_connected+` status variable can result in your code (that in this simple example sets the `innerHTML` property) to be called more than once if, for example, you experience temporary network failures or if the server restarts. +
Therefore, the code that you put in the `+_connectionEstablished()+` function must be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotent[idempotent].
  In other words, make sure that if the `+_connectionEstablished()+` function is called more than one time, it will behave exactly as if it is called only once.
